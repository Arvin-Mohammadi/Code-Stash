# Pong Game
This project is about making use of the MPU-6050 sensor as a ping-pong racket in a python-generated pong-game. The segmentation is as explained below: 

1. Chapter 0: INTRODUCTION
   - Sensors: MPU-6050 and MPU-9250
   - Methods of extracting data 
   - Calibration 
   - Kalman and Complementary filters
   - Processing data with Python 
   - Game Design with Python 
2. Chapter 1: DATA EXTRACTION
   - Setup of the Arduino kit
   - Data extraction 
   - Plotting the data
3. Chapter 2: FILTERS
   - Kalman filter on raw data
   - Complementary filter
4. Chapter 3: DATA PROCESSING
   - Rotation matrix (from roll, pitch yaw)
   - Rotation matrix (from quaternion values)
5. Chapter 4: GAME DESIGN 
   - Making the game with Python 
   - MPU-6050 data to Game input
